CSE 143 advances one particular set of values about computing. In CSE 143:

Algorithms are more important than data.
: Compare to [CSE 163: Intermediate Data Programming](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/overview/intro-courses#cse163).

Technical questions are more important than creative questions.
: Compare to [CSE 154: Web Programming](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/overview/intro-courses#cse154).

Programming solutions are more important than the problems they solve.
: Compare to [CSE 180: Introduction to Data Science](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/overview/intro-courses#cse180).

But this course is about more than just programming ideas. **We are a community of learners**, defined by how we conduct ourselves, how we communicate with each other, and how we care about each other. I believe everyone can succeed and grow as a whole human being together in this course. But to realize this vision, we'll need to work together to act compassionately and treat all others as we wish to be treated ourselves: to think first of others, their benefit, their well-being, and their learning. We are only as good as we are to each other.

The following behaviors serve as first steps towards creating a compassionate community.

- Listen with intention to understand first and forming an opinion only after you fully understand.
- Take responsibility for the intended and unintended effects of your words and actions on others.
- Mindfully respond to others' ideas by acknowledging the unique value of each contribution.
