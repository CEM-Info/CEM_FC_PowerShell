Recursive enumeration and recursive optimization are both solved by applying **recursive backtracking**.

Recursive backtracking
: A recursive algorithm idea that solves problems by recursively generating solutions.

When solving any recursive backtracking problem, programmers ask three questions.

What type of problem are we solving?
: Recursive enumeration.
: Recursive optimization.

What is the form of a valid solution?
: Ordered lists with repetition.
: Unordered sets without repetition.

What is the data type of a valid solution?
: Primitive types (such as numbers) or strings.
: Reference types (such as collections), which require choose-explore-unchoose.
